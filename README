Boolean Propagation Solver & SillyCon
-------------------------------------
The Boolean Propagation Solver (BPS) is a C library for solving Boolean
Propagation Problems. See documentation for more information. 

SillyCon is an interpretor for a silly constraint language with Boolean
and numerical constraints. See documentation for more information.

Instructions
------------
These instructions are for a Linux or Unix-like system.

The software was created on a GNU/Linux system
using the gcc compiler.

The C code is simple and uses only standard library
functions. It should not be hard to get it working on other
operating systems. 

To build programs from source, type

    make

To install the SillyCon interpretor system wide, type

    sudo make install

The test program and the sillycon program are created in the bin
directory. Only sillycon is installed system wide by make install.

The examples directory contains input files that can be used 
for the test program (*.prop) and examples that can be used
for the sillycon program (*.silly)

To run a test, from the bps directory, type
    
    bin/test exmaples/test1.prop

To run a sillycon test

    bin/sillycon exmaples/sqrt.silly

For using SillyCon interpretor and Boolean Propagation Solver, 
see documentation files.
