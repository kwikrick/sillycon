<p>
SillyCon is a silly constraint language.
It allows one to specify integer constraint problems, and it solves them for you!
</p>

<p>
An integer constraint problem
is an expression with numbers, variables and operators (such as addition,
multiplication, comparisons, boolean logic, and some special constraint solving
operators). A constraint problem defines the allowed values of the variables. 
A constraint problem is solved by a constraint solver (also part of SillyCon) which
returns one or more solutions (i.e. values for the variables) if there are any. 
</p>

</p>
Constraint problems in SillyCon are entered using a prefix notation. All puctuation 
characters are operators. All alphabetic characters are variables. Seqeuences of digits
are numbers. Whitespace is ignored (but may be used to separate numbers). 
Note that its not possible to declare variable names (or operators) of 
more than one character. This is a bit silly. 
</p>

<p>
The SillyCon interpretor program accepts input from the stdin stream or from a file given 
as the first command line argument. As soon as a complete expression has been entered (i.e. each operator
has the required number of operands), it will be considered a 
problem and it will be solved. 
</p>

<p>
(The SillyCon web demo accepts input from a form, or in the URL 
using a POST format ?expression=...).
</p>

<p>
Typing:
</pre>
  =10*xy
</pre>
<p>(Meaning x*y=10)</p>
<p>
Will give:
<pre>
    x = 1 & y = 10
    x = 2 & y = 5
    x = 5 & y= 2
    x = 10 & y = 1
    x = -1 & y = -10
    x = -2 & y = -5
    x = -5 & y= -2
    x = -10 & y = -1
</pre>

<p>
To solve problems, the input expression is converted to a Boolean 
propagation problem and solved using the <a href="bps.html">Boolean Propagation Solver</a>.
Some statistics will be shown before, during and after the solving process. 
</p>

<h2>Input Language</h2>

<p>The input is a sequence of expressions. Each expression is interpreted as a
separate problem and solved seperately, i.e. constraints on variables in one problem 
are not passed to then next problem.
</p>

</p>
An expression is a variable, a constant, or a composite expression
consisting of an operator and one or more subexpressions.
</p>

<p>
Constants are sequences of digits; e.g 1 100 828527 00027
</p>

<p>
Variables are single alphabetic characters a-z and A-Z; so
'Foo' and 'bar' are just sequences of three variables, the interpretation
depenends on the context (i.e. preceding operator). 
For example, '+xy' or '*px' are complete expressions; 
i.e. one operator with two operands. 
</p>

<p>
Constants and variables are signed integer numbers. 
Negative constants are entered using the unary - operator. 
The result of an operator is also a signed integer number. 
</p>

<p>
In geneneral, numbers (i.e. constants or results of operators) 
can be any number of bits. However, variables have a fixed size, 
i.e. the number of bits. This is currently hard-coded in the program
(by a #define) but this will probaby be made dynamic in the future.
</p>

<p>
The internal binary representation (i.e. after integer probems are converted to
binary problems) is two's compliment. (You may want to know this if you use the
boolean operators on numbers).  
</p>

<p>
Operators are single punctuation characters; operators have
1 or 2 operands. Operands can be any expression, i.e. a constant,
a variables or an operator-expression. 
</p>

<p>
The accepted operators are the following:
</p>

<pre>
symbol  name    arity   meaning
-------------------------------
integer arithmetic:
-       NEG     1       integer negation
+       ADD     2       integer addition
*       MUL     2       integer multiplication
/       DIV     2       integer division (quotient)
%       MOD     2       integer floor modulus (remainder)

integer comparison:
=       EQUAL   2       1 if operands are equal (bit for bit), otherwise 0
&gt;       GT      2       1 if operand 1 greater than operand 2, otherwise 0
&lt;       LT      2       1 if operand 1 less than operand 2, otherwise 0

boolean logic:
!       NOT     1       binary NOT
&       AND     2       binary AND   
|       OR      2       binary OR 
^       XOR     2       binary XOR
:       IMPL    2       binary IMPL

solving:
@       CON     1       constrain the operand equal to 1
#       COUNT   1       number of solutions of operand 1
$       MAX     2       maximum value of operand 1 for all solutions of operand 2   
_       MIN     2       minimum value of operand 1 for all solutions of operand 2
'       EVAL    2       set of values of operand 1 for all solutions of operand 2
`       IND     2       union of constraints of operand 1 where variables in operand 1 
			are replaced by variables pointed to by values of those
			variables in solutions of operand 2        
special:
?       PNTR    1       A pointer. Convert a number to variable (vice versa in an IND)
"       comment

(reserved: . , \ [] () ~ ; )
</pre>

<p>
Comments are encosed in a pair of double quotes: "this is a comment"
</p>

<p>
The '?' (PNTR, short for 'pointer') symbol, followed by a number, can be used for numbered variables.
So '?1' refers to a variable and '?2' refers to another variable. 
Variable '?65' to '?90' are the same as variables 'A' to 'Z' 
and '?97' to '?122' equal 'a' to 'z'. 
Note that the number following '?' cannot be determined by 
solving a sub-expression. It must be a literal, positive number. 
The maximum variable number is currently 
hard-coded to 999, but this may change in future releases. 
<p>
</p>
Note that Inside the IND expression, the PNTR operator works the other way around. It converts
the name of a variable (again, not a complete expression, but a single character variable name)
to a number, i.e. the value of that variable in the solution of right hand side expression. 
(It would actually more logical to use the PNTR in an IND as it works outside, but allow variables
used in a PNTR. Normal variables will than simply take on a value, and pointers can be used
to refer to variables. We might do this in the future, However, this will break backwards compatibility.) 
</p>

<p>
The COUNT, EVAL, MIN, MAX and IND operators will interpret one 
operand (the only one for COUNT, or the second one for the others) 
as a sub-problem and solve it. 
After solving this sub-problem, the
first operand (of MIN,MAX,EVAL,IND) will be converted into a new expression,
which is part of the main problem. (And this problem will be solved in the
normal solving process).
</p>

<p>
Note that MIN and MAX operators do not generate all solutions for the
subproblem. In fact, they are quite efficient. The boolean variables are
ordered such that the first solution found is the desired solution.  On the other
hand, the COUNT, EVAL and IND operators will generate all solutions for he
sub-problem, so these can be very expensive operations. 
</p>

<p>
A root expression (or problem) is implicitly constrained to 1 (see @ operator) if it starts
with a boolean operator or comparator (EQ, NOT, GREATER, etc.). If
the root expression is a numerical expression (see ADD, SUB, etc.) the
result will be constrained equal to a variable '?1'. 
</p>

<p>Also, the problem solving
operators (see EVAL, IND, MIN, MAX and COUNT) will implicitly
constrain the subproblem expression (one of the input expressions) to 1.
</p>

<p>
So, the following numerical expession 
<pre>	
	+ 3 4
</pre> 
will be interpreted as the following problem
<pre>
	@=?1+3 4
</pre> 
(and the solution will be ?1=7)
</p>

<p>
And the following boolean expression
<pre>
	=x3 
</pre>
will be interpreted as the following problem
<pre>
	@=x3 
</pre>
(and the solution will be x=3)
</p>
